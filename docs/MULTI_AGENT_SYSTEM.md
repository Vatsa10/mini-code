## Commands

### List Agents
```
> /agents
```
Shows all available agents and their roles.

### Execute Single Agent Task
```
> /agent <role> <task>
```

Examples:
```
> /agent architect Design a REST API for user management
> /agent developer Implement a binary search function
> /agent reviewer Review this authentication code
> /agent tester Create tests for the login function
> /agent debugger Why is this function returning undefined?
> /agent documenter Document this API endpoint
```

### Collaborative Code Review
```
> /review <filepath>
```

Multiple agents collaborate to:
1. **Reviewer** analyzes code quality
2. **Developer** suggests improvements
3. **Tester** creates test cases

Example:
```
> /review src/auth/login.ts
```

### Multi-Agent Debugging
```
> /debug <filepath>
```

Specialized debugging workflow:
1. Runs the code to capture errors
2. **Debugger** analyzes the error
3. **Developer** creates a fix
4. **Documenter** explains the solution

Example:
```
> /debug src/utils/parser.js
```

### Feature Implementation
```
> /implement <feature description>
```

End-to-end feature development:
1. **Architect** designs the solution
2. **Developer** implements the code
3. **Tester** creates tests
4. **Documenter** writes documentation

Example:
```
> /implement Add user authentication with JWT tokens
> /implement Create a file upload component with progress bar
```

### Workflow Planning
```
> /workflow <goal>
```

**Architect** creates a step-by-step plan with agent assignments.

Example:
```
> /workflow Build a todo list application with React
> /workflow Refactor the database layer to use TypeORM
```

## Workflow Examples

### 1. Building a New Feature

```
> /workflow Add user profile editing feature

[Architect creates plan]

> /agent architect Design the profile editing UI and API

[Review design]

> /implement User profile editing with validation

[Gets design, implementation, tests, and docs]

> /review src/components/ProfileEditor.tsx

[Multiple agents review the code]
```

### 2. Debugging Complex Issues

```
> /debug src/api/payment.ts

[Multi-agent debugging]

> /agent debugger Explain why the payment fails on retry

[Detailed analysis]

> /agent developer Implement exponential backoff for retries

[Implementation]

> /agent tester Create tests for retry logic

[Test cases]
```

### 3. Code Quality Improvement

```
> /review src/legacy/oldCode.js

[Collaborative review]

> /agent reviewer What security issues exist in this code?

[Security analysis]

> /agent developer Refactor this code with modern patterns

[Refactored code]

> /agent tester Create comprehensive tests

[Test suite]
```

### 4. Documentation Sprint

```
> /agent documenter Create API documentation for the user service

[API docs]

> /agent documenter Write a getting started guide

[User guide]

> /agent architect Document the system architecture

[Architecture docs]
```

### 5. Test Coverage Improvement

```
> /agent tester Analyze test coverage for auth module

[Coverage analysis]

> /agent tester Create missing tests for edge cases

[Additional tests]

> /agent reviewer Review the test quality

[Test review]
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Sequential Agent Collaboration

```
> /agent architect Design a caching layer
[Get design]

> /agent developer Implement the caching layer based on this design
[Get implementation]

> /agent tester Create tests for the caching layer
[Get tests]

> /agent reviewer Review the complete solution
[Get review]
```

### Parallel Agent Consultation

```
> /agent reviewer What are the security concerns?
> /agent tester What test scenarios should we cover?
> /agent architect How should this scale?
```

### Iterative Refinement

```
> /implement User authentication

[Review output]

> /agent reviewer What could be improved?

[Get suggestions]

> /agent developer Apply these improvements

[Get refined code]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Agent
- Use **Architect** for design decisions
- Use **Developer** for implementation
- Use **Reviewer** for quality checks
- Use **Tester** for test creation
- Use **Debugger** for error analysis
- Use **Documenter** for documentation

### 2. Provide Context
Give agents relevant information:
```
> /read src/config.ts
> /agent architect Design a new config system based on this
```

### 3. Use Collaborative Commands
For complex tasks, use multi-agent commands:
- `/review` for comprehensive code review
- `/debug` for thorough debugging
- `/implement` for complete feature development

### 4. Build Workflows
For large projects, create workflows:
```
> /workflow Migrate from REST to GraphQL
```

### 5. Iterate and Refine
Don't accept first output, iterate:
```
> /agent developer Create a user service
> /agent reviewer Review this implementation
> /agent developer Improve based on review
```

## Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Design → Implement → Test → Document
```
/agent architect → /agent developer → /agent tester → /agent documenter
```

### Debug → Fix → Test → Document
```
/debug file.ts → /agent tester → /agent documenter
```

### Review → Improve → Re-review
```
/review file.ts → /agent developer → /review file.ts
```

### Plan → Execute → Validate
```
/workflow goal → /agent developer → /agent reviewer
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Clear tasks get better results
2. **Provide Context**: Share relevant code and files
3. **Use Right Agent**: Match task to agent expertise
4. **Iterate**: Refine outputs through multiple agents
5. **Combine Commands**: Use /read, /search before agent tasks

## Limitations

- Each agent call makes an API request
- Complex workflows may take time
- Agents work independently (no shared memory between calls)
- Results depend on task clarity

## Future Enhancements

Planned features:
- Agent memory and learning
- Custom agent creation
- Agent-to-agent communication
- Workflow automation
- Result caching
- Parallel agent execution

## Examples by Use Case

### Starting a New Project
```
/workflow Create a REST API with Express and TypeScript
/agent architect Design the folder structure
/implement User authentication endpoint
```

### Fixing Bugs
```
/debug src/buggy.ts
/agent debugger Explain the root cause
/agent developer Implement the fix
```

### Improving Code Quality
```
/review src/messy.ts
/agent reviewer List all issues
/agent developer Refactor with best practices
```

### Writing Tests
```
/agent tester Create unit tests for this module
/agent tester Add integration tests
/agent reviewer Review test coverage
```

### Creating Documentation
```
/agent documenter Write API documentation
/agent documenter Create usage examples
/agent documenter Document architecture decisions
```

The multi-agent system transforms MiniCode from a simple assistant into a collaborative development team!
